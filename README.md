# complementizers-ptb-data

This repository reproduces the dataset on complementizers analyzed in [Bleaman & Kommerell 2024, "A computational approach to detecting the envelope of variation."](https://doi.org/10.1515/lingvan-2023-0157) To run our script `treebank_data.py`, make sure that your NLTK library has access to a licensed local copy of the Penn Treebank (downloaded to a location such as [`nltk_data/corpora/ptb/`](https://www.nltk.org/data.html)), specifically the `BROWN` and `WSJ` subcorpora.
